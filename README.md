# COVID-19-Outbreaks-in-Nursing-Homes
A Qualitative Descriptive Study Comprising of Discussions And Recommendations


During the first wave of COVID-19 infections in the US, Nursing homes across the United States became ground zero from the transmission and death from the disease. Multiple factors can be linked to why nursing homes were hot spots in the pandemic, such as congregate living, underlying health conditions in the elderly population, staff shortage, amongst others. 

This project utilizes Nursing Home COVID-19 Public surveillance data to investigate the extent of the infections, recoveries, mortality, and vaccination rates across various nursing centers in the US. While the long-term clinical and social implications of the pandemic are still being uncovered, the results from this project can serve as a decision-making guide on how to effectively allocate resources and mitigate excessive risks for long-term care facility preparedness in the event of a pandemic.
